This is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript app. It is for users who wish to test their arithmetic skills with a gamified format. The user is given a random number at the start of the game. There are four crystals. By clicking on a crystal the user will add a specific amount of points to her or his total score. You win the game by matching your score to the random number, and you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number. The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time the game starts, the game will change the value of the crystals.
